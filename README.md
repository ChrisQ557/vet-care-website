   ```sh

## 📝 Sign in Instructions

- **Sign in using the email:** `eve.holt@reqres.in`
- **A nickname is required** when signing in or registering. This is because the Reqres API does not check passwords, so appointments are stored locally and filtered by nickname for demo purposes.

---

## 🎨 Customization

- Update text in `.html` files for your own content
- Add or change images in `assets/images/`
- Adjust layout/colors in `assets/css/styles.css`
- Extend features by editing or adding JS in `assets/js/`

---

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

For full testing documentation including HTML/CSS/JS validation, Lighthouse audits, feature testing, responsiveness, browser compatibility, and accessibility — see the dedicated **[TESTING.md](TESTING.md)** file.

---

## 🚦 Known Issues & Limitations

- All users must use the same email to register/sign in (Reqres API limitation)
- User-specific appointments are filtered by a frontend-only “nickname” field
- Anyone with the shared email and any password accepted by Reqres can sign in
- Nickname-based filtering is for demo purposes only and not secure
